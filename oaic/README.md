# AI-Commander OpenAI API Library (for AI-Ronaut)

This project aims to provide direct access to the OpenAI API and will eventually serve as the primary foundation for the AI-Ronaut GUI client project (https://github.com/asianirish/AI-Ronaut). Currently, the project is in a testing phase and will later be transformed into a static library project. Eventually, it may be moved to a separate public repository and used as a submodule for the AI-Ronaut project. The source code of the library's repository will be distributed under the same license as the AI-Ronaut project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the library for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
