TODO:

* ModelContext per a Session instead ModelContext per a Page
* One session in two different pages
* Response problem. Parsing error for the string:

DONE:

* The first letter of the message is lost when saving
* Always make use of sessions
* Make the input area narrower horizontally (chat)
* Every page should have its own currentSession (delete from SessionManager)
* Rename update* functions
* Assign a separate instance of MessagePtr to each MessageItemWidget
* Add the current time and extension to the file name (chat)
* Error parsing JSON:unterminated array
* use chat::Manager as a Manager per Page
    * Ensure that ChatWidget::onMessageResponseStream does not accept data from unrelated sessions
    * Add the ability to cancel sending an Assistant message for each session individually, without affecting messages being sent in other sessions.
* If the input field is empty, just forward the entire array of messages again
* Update session name across all tabs upon renaming
    * use SessionItem::_sessionId instead of SessionItem::_sessionData
* Delete struct chat::SessionData
* Fix the issue: Rename not the selected session in the list widget, but the current one for this tab
(See ChatSessionWidget::onRenameSession)
* Do not select a new session if a session has already been created on another page
* The menu leads to a loss of focus and, as a result, the loss of the ability to edit (in ChatSessionItem)
* Rename role as AssistantRole to Character or Bot
* Make PageContext inherit from QObject and emit a signal on session change
* createSession emits a signal when _pageContex doesn't exist (see PageGeneralChatPage::PageGeneralChatPage)

CANCELED:
* Update messages problem (What a problem?)
