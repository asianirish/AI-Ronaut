TODO:

* ModelContext per a Session instead ModelContext per a Page

* convert chat::Manager to a non-singleton class and use it as a Manager per Page instead
    * Ensure that ChatWidget::onMessageResponseStream does not accept data from unrelated sessions
    * Add the ability to cancel sending an Assistant message for each session individually, without affecting messages being sent in other sessions.

DONE:

* The first letter of the message is lost when saving
* Always make use of sessions
* Make the input area narrower horizontally (chat)
* Every page should have its own currentSession (delete from SessionManager)
* Rename update* functions
* Assign a separate instance of MessagePtr to each MessageItemWidget
* Add the current time and extension to the file name (chat)
* Error parsing JSON:unterminated array

CANCELED:

* If the input field is empty, just forward the entire array of messages again
